"""
Test suite for the solve_problem function.

Since no examples were provided, this test suite only includes a basic smoke test
to verify the function exists and can be called. The function appears to take no arguments
and returns None based on the type annotations.

To properly test the function's behavior, specific input/output examples would be needed.
