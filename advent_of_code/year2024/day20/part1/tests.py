"""
Tests for counting effective cheating shortcuts in a race track map.

The tests verify that the solution correctly identifies the number of wall shortcuts 
that would save at least 100 picoseconds compared to the fastest legal path from start (S) 
to end (E) on a race track map where:
- '#' represents walls
- '.' represents valid track
- 'S' represents the starting position
- 'E' represents the end position

A "cheat" involves breaking through a wall, and must save at least 100 picoseconds
compared to the fastest legal path to be counted.
