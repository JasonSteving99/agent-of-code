```text
A group of cute Christmas elves (the Historians and "you") stand at the front desk of a festive onsen on Gear Island, decorated with holiday lights and snowy details.  They gesture towards colorful striped towels, attempting to arrange them in specific patterns dictated by a stylish elf Onsen Branding Expert, while the friendly onsen staff look on with amusement.  The scene takes place in a cozy, warm interior with a view of Gear Island's snowy hot springs visible through a large window.  The style should be whimsical and fun, suitable for a children's graphic novel, evoking Christmas cheer. Minimize text.
