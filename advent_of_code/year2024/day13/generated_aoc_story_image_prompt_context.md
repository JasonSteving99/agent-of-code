### Extracted the following story summary from today's AoC problem HTML:
```json
{
    "summarized_story": "The Historians explore a tropical resort and discover an arcade with unusual claw machines. These machines have buttons labeled 'A' and 'B' instead of joysticks, and each button press costs tokens.  Each machine's buttons move the claw a specific amount along the X and Y axes. The goal is to position the claw directly above a prize to win it, spending the fewest tokens possible.  Initially, the narrator tries to figure out the cheapest way to win as many prizes as possible by pressing the buttons a limited number of times. Later, they discover a unit conversion error that significantly shifted the prize locations, requiring a recalculation of the optimal strategy to win prizes.",

A cute Christmas elf, wearing a Santa hat and holding a handful of tokens, puzzles over a claw machine in a tropical resort arcade with hexagonal floor tiles. The claw machine, decorated with festive lights and candy canes, contains plush toys of tropical creatures like pineapples, flamingos, and toucans. The background shows other elves enjoying the arcade, with palm trees and a beach visible through large windows. The arcade has a whimsical, Christmas-y feel, despite the tropical setting.
