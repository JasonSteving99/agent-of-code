"""Unit tests for Part 2 of the claw machine prize problem.

This test suite validates the min_tokens_part2 function which calculates the minimum number
of tokens needed to potentially win prizes in a claw machine game where the prize coordinates
are significantly larger numbers. Each configuration is represented by two buttons (A and B)
that move the claw in different X,Y increments, and a prize location given in absolute X,Y coordinates.
