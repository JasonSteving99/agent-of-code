"""
Tests for the garden fencing price calculator.

These tests verify the functionality of calculating total fencing prices for garden regions where:
- Each character in the input represents a plot with a plant type
- Connected plots (horizontally/vertically) of the same plant type form regions
- Each region's fencing price = area (number of plots) Ã— perimeter (sides not touching same plant)
- Total price is sum of all region fencing prices

The tests cover:
1. Simple rectangular regions with different plant types
2. Symmetric garden with alternating patterns
3. Complex garden with multiple irregular regions and nested areas
