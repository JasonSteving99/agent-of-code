"""
Tests for the garden plot fencing price calculation function.

The tests verify that given a map of garden plots represented as a string with newlines,
where each letter represents a plot with a specific plant type, the function correctly:
1. Identifies distinct regions of connected same-letter plots (connected horizontally/vertically)
2. Calculates the price for each region (area Ã— perimeter)
3. Returns the sum of all region prices as a string

A region's:
- Area is the count of connected plots with the same letter
- Perimeter is the count of exposed sides (borders with different letters or map edges)
