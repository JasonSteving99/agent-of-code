"""
Test suite for calculate_total_fence_cost function.

The tests verify that the function correctly calculates the total cost of fencing regions
of plants in a garden grid where:
- Each character represents a different type of plant
- Regions are formed by horizontally or vertically adjacent same-type plants
- Cost per region = area (number of plants) Ã— perimeter (exposed sides)
- Total cost is the sum of all region costs
