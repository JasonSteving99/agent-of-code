"""
This test suite covers the calculation of total fencing price for garden plots where:
- Input is a multiline string representing a map of garden plots
- Each character represents a type of plant
- Regions are formed by horizontally/vertically adjacent identical characters
- Price for a region = area Ã— perimeter
- Total price is sum of all region prices
- Output should be returned as a string

Test cases cover:
1. Small map with simple regions
2. Medium map with alternating pattern
3. Large map with complex regions
