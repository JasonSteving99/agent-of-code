"""
Tests for the calculate_total_fencing_price function which computes the total fencing price for plant regions.

Each region's cost is calculated as (area Ã— perimeter).
The total cost is the sum of all region costs.

Test cases cover:
1. Basic map with simple regions and different letters
2. Map with internal regions ("O" surrounding "X" pattern)
3. Large complex map with multiple region types and varied connectivity
