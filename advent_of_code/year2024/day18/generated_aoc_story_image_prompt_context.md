### Extracted the following story summary from today's AoC problem HTML:
```json
{
    "summarized_story": "You and The Historians are trapped inside a computer at the North Pole.  A program warns you that an algorithm is about to corrupt the computer's memory with falling bytes.  You need to find a safe path through the memory grid from the top left corner to the bottom right corner before the falling bytes block the way.  After 1024 bytes fall, you need to find the shortest path to the exit. The second part involves finding the coordinates of the first byte that makes reaching the exit impossible.",
    "cast": [
        "You",
        "The Historians",
        "A program"
    ],
    "setting": "Inside a computer at the North Pole. The computer's memory space is a two-dimensional grid with coordinates that range from 0 to 70 both horizontally and vertically."

### The following meta image generation prompt was generated from the above story summary:
```text
A group of cute Christmas elves (you and The Historians) are huddled inside a festive, candy-cane-striped computer at the North Pole, facing a worried program elf with glowing binary code eyes.  Falling, glittery snowflakes (representing bytes) cascade down a grid-like path within the computer, some blocking squares on a path from the top left to the bottom right. The elves look determined and slightly panicked, pointing towards the bottom right exit as the snowflakes accumulate. The scene is lit with warm Christmas lights and filled with whimsical details like gingerbread men circuit boards and gumdrop buttons, creating a sense of urgency but maintaining a lighthearted, fun atmosphere. Minimize text.
