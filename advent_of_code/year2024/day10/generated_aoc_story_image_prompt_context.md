A cute reindeer in a hardhat presents a blank topographic map and surveying tools to a group of cheerful elves inside a whimsical sky-island lava production facility, surrounded by piles of pencils, markers, rulers, compasses, stickers, protractors, toothpicks, and colorful bits of paper. The reindeer holds a scorched hiking guide in one hoof, while tiny toothpick flags mark points on the map, hinting at a fun adventure.  The scene is brightly lit with a festive, Christmas-time atmosphere, perfect for an elf-themed graphic novel.  Everything has a playful, slightly cartoonish style. Minimize large text.
