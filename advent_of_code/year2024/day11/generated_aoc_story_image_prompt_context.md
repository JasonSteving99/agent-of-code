### Extracted the following story summary from today's AoC problem HTML:
```json
{
    "summarized_story": "While exploring ancient civilization ruins on Pluto, you encounter a line of numbered stones that change each time you blink.  The stones split, change values, or multiply based on the digits engraved on them. The Historians are busy exploring elsewhere.",
    "cast": [
        "The Historians",
        "you"
    ],
    "setting": "A straight line of stones on Pluto, inside infinite corridors."
}
```

### The following meta image generation prompt was generated from the above story summary:
```text
A cute elf protagonist stands puzzled before a line of glowing, numbered Christmas ornament-like stones within Pluto's icy, infinite corridors, decorated with festive lights and garlands for the holiday season. The stones magically shift and multiply as the elf blinks, some splitting into smaller ornaments, others changing numbers like a playful puzzle.  A group of historian elves, dressed in whimsical, colorful winter attire, examines ancient markings on the corridor walls nearby, oblivious to the stone's magical behavior. The scene is filled with a sense of wonder and Christmas cheer, perfect for a graphic novel. Minimal text, please.
